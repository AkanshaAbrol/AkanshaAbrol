## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with 2 years experience of working in the IT field. Throughout these years I have worked on Mainframe-based applications and legacy application modernization tools like AWS Blu Age. I also have a keen interest in learning cloud-based technologies and got certified in AWS and Azure cloud practitioner skills. My current interests and explorations involve Java, Spring Boot, Javascript, and MySQL technologies. I want to contribute to robust and user-friendly software solutions.
